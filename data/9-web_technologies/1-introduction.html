    <p>The objective of this course is for you to develop an understanding of what the internet is, and how it works. At the end of this course you will be able to create interactive web pages and will be able to write simple programming code in JavaScript.</p>
    <h4>How to use these pages</h4>
    <p>This course is designed to run at your own pace. If you fly through it, great! Move on to the next page, but make sure you answer all questions and complete any extension tasks first. These will make sure you understand what you're doing.</p>
    <p>If you find you're going slower, that's ok too. Ask for help if you need it.</p>
    <p>But most importantly, <strong>READ</strong> everything on these pages. Don't just skip to the code sections, you'll miss a lot on the way.</p>
    <p><strong>Don't copy and paste</strong> the code either. By typing it, you're improving your typing skills, and learning how each line works.</p>
    <p>As much as possible, technical terms will be in <em>italics</em>, while instructions or important notes will be in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>
    <p>Blocks of code will appear in dark boxes.</p>
    <p>References to small sections of code <code>will be in boxes like this.</code></p>

    <p>At then end of this lesson, you will have a basic understanding of how to save your work, how to upload files to Connect, and what the internet is.</p>

    <h3>Setup tasks</h3>
    <p>Before we begin, create a <em>Year 9 Digital Technologies</em> folder in your <strong>My Documents</strong> for this course. Make sure you are working under <em>Computer -&gt; My Documents</em>, <strong>not</strong> <em>Libraries -&gt; Documents</em>.</p>
    <p>Inside the folder you have just created, add another new folder called <em>HTML</em></p>
    <h4>Text Editors</h4>
    <p>Web pages are simple text files, so we will be using a text editor, <em>VS Code</em>. Find and open <em>VS Code</em> now.</p>

    <h4>Background Information</h4>
    <p>Create a new text file in <strong>VS Code</strong>. At the top of the page <strong>write your name</strong>. Underneath, write <em>Background Information</em>.</p>
    <p>Save your page in the <em>HTML</em> folder you created as <em>background_information.txt</em></p>
    <p>Answer the following questions <strong>in full sentences and/or paragraphs</strong> in your text file:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>What is a computer?</li>
        <li>What is a network?</li>
        <li>What is a server?</li>
        <li>What is the internet?</li>
        <li>What is a browser?</li>
        <li>List all the browsers you have used on ALL your devices.</li>
        <li>Which browser do you prefer to use, and why?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When you have finished writing your answers <strong>in full sentences</strong>, save your file and upload it to <em>Connect</em>.</p>
